# Bureau_Benchmarking

This project was assigned to me to check the richness of the data coming from every credit bureau. For this excersise we have consider following bureaus.
> 1) CIBIL
> 2) EXPERIAN
> 3) CRIF
> 4) EQUIFAX

## STEP-1:
>> First I have prepared a base data of customers. In this base we have added all the demographic data of the customer. This base data was of size greater than 2 lakhs customers. Finally sent it to all the bureaus for scrubbing.

## STEP-2:
>> Once I have received srub data from each bureau, then I did basic sanity check of the data.

## STEP-3:
>> In step 3 I have prepared all the required variables or features on basis of which we will do further analysis.

## STEP-4:
>> Preparation of analysis presentation.

This analysis was done based on city tier and the density of data given by every bureau for each type of city tier.
